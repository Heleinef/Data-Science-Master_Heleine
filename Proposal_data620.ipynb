        "The aim of this project is to perform text and network analysis on Twitter posts made by ISIS supporters before the 2015 attack on Paris. By analyzing these tweets, we hope to provide useful insights into the pro-ISIS network of users, common themes in their communication, and the geographic distribution of the tweets. The analysis will help understand the sentiment and dissemination patterns among ISIS supporters, which can assist in making informed decisions in counter-terrorism strategies.\n",
